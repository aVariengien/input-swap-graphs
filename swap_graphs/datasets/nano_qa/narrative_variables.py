The sound of birdsong filled the air, but it was soon joined by another melody â€“ the architect's voice, soaring with joy and passion, a song of creation and ambition.

As the air filled with the sweet melodies of street musicians, the astronomer couldn't resist the urge to dance, twirling around in the piazza with such grace and enthusiasm that he soon became the center of attention.
